## Overview
A side project I'm working on to help me learn the HTML Canvas API and how to manipulate it on videos.
The implementation for the original idea can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Manipulating_video_using_canvas). Though the MDN implementation reads the video from file, this version here relies on the user's webcam.
